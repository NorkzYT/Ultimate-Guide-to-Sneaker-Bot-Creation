### The Most Important Tool: Chrome devTools

When getting into the creation of Sneaker Bot, the most important skill you need to know is how to use the Chrome devTools.

For Browser-like bot, you will need to use the elements panel in order to get the right selector or XPath for the HTML Element that you want to target.

Meanwhile, for request-based bot you will need to use the network panel, in order to analyse the requests that get sent from the website to the server (when adding a product to the cart for example).
